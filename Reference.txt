1. Data Preparation:

Gather Images: 
        Collect a diverse set of images containing web browsers with address bars visible. The more variations you have (different browsers, window sizes, background colors, text fonts),
 the better your model will generalize.
Annotate Address Bars: 
            Use an image annotation tool (e.g., VGG Image Annotator (VIA) or LabelImg) to create bounding boxes around the address bars in each image.
 Ensure the annotations are accurate for optimal training.

2. YOLO Training:

Choose a YOLO Version: 
            Popular choices for object detection include YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8. Consider factors like complexity, training speed, and accuracy requirements
 when selecting a version.
Train the YOLO Model: 
            Use a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow to train your YOLO model on the annotated dataset. This will involve setting training parameters
             (learning rate, batch size, epochs) and monitoring the training process to avoid overfitting.

3. Address Text Extraction (Optional):

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Once YOLO detects the address bar region in an image using the bounding box, you can leverage OCR libraries like Tesseract or
 PyTesseract to extract the actual text within the address bar. Note that OCR accuracy can vary depending on text clarity and complexity.

CODE

# Import libraries
import torch
from yolov5 import Detector

# Load trained YOLO model
model = Detector("path/to/your/yolov5s.pt")

# Function to extract address text
def extract_address_text(image_path):
    # Load image
    image = torch.as_tensor(cv2.imread(image_path))

    # Perform YOLO detection
    results = model(image)

    # Check for detected address bar (assuming class ID for address bar is 0)
    if results.pandas().xyxy[0]['name'] == 0:
        # Get bounding box coordinates
        x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max = results.pandas().xyxy[0][['xmin', 'ymin', 'xmax', 'ymax']].tolist()

        # Crop image for address bar region
        address_bar_image = image[:, y_min:y_max, x_min:x_max]

        # Apply OCR to extract text
        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(address_bar_image)
        return text
    else:
        return "Address bar not detected"

# Example usage
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
extracted_text = extract_address_text(image_path)
print(f"Extracted text: {extracted_text}")
